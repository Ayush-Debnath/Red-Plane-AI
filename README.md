# 🛩️ Red Plane AI
A reinforcement learning game using NEAT



Red Plane AI is a twist on the classic Flappy Bird game — but with more attitude, more challenge, and a brainy AI that learns how to fly like a boss. Built with **Python**, **Pygame**, and **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)**, this game lets you either play manually or watch the AI evolve into a high-flying legend.

> Think Flappy Bird... but smarter, sassier, and redder.
